My name is Ethan Sorensen. I'm a third year student at BYU studying electrical engineering. When I'm not in the lab or working on a personal project, I love to be out with family and friends, or lost in the woods somewhere. Take a look at some my __Projects__ tab to see what I'm passionate about, and take a look at my __Photo Gallery__ tab to learn more about me as a person.
