    <h1>Welcome to the EthaNet</h1>
    <p>I'm Ethan, a senior electrical engineering student at BYU originally from Los Angeles, California. I currently work for BYU's <a href="https://netlab.byu.edu/">Network Enhanced Technologies Lab</a> (NET Lab), where we focus on wireless networks, Internet of Things, security, privacy, and reliability. When I'm not plugged directly into the lab, I could be anywhere - being a mediocre photographer, attempting to rock climb anything taller than a shrub, building up my dream gaming rig & homelab setup, and most importantly, spending time with my wonderful wife, Sarah.</p>

## What is the EthaNet?

This *is* the EthaNet. I built it as an opportunity for me to share a bit about myself both professionally and personally. The name "EthaNet" is actually the name of the wireless protocol my friends and I developed as the final project of a graduate class on SDRs. We were stumped for a name, and after many cringey ideas, out of desperation the name "EthaNet" was born. But you know what? It sort of fits...

While I am proud to say that most, if not quite all, of the written content is generated by these 10 fingers right here, the surrounding HTML, CSS, and JS are not. For that, I took my original website template, a fork of Minimal Mistakes, and upgraded and tweaked it with the help of [Anthropic's Claude](https://claude.com/product/claude-code). You can learn more about my perspective on AI and its usage on my __Personal__ page, where I try to post little stories that highlight (mostly technical) aspects of my life and topics I find interesting.

## What else is on the EthaNet?

The entirety of this website is a hodge-podge collection of stuff in the category "things I had time to do." Most of them are technical in some form, because I don't really have social media or anything which reflects my personal life. You can see the pages at the top, which show the following sides of me:

- My __Professional__ page showcases the official representation of me. It has my up-to-date resume, active coursework and experience, and a full list of my skills.
- If you want to see what I'm *really* capable of, you might look at the  __Nerd__ page to what I actually spend my technical free time on.
- To get to know me a little better personally, feel free to look at my __Personal__ tab to learn more about my perspective and occasionally some of the hijinx I get myself into. My socials are also listed when you hover over the "EthaNet" at the top of the page.
