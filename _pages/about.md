My name is Ethan Sorensen. Originally from Los Angeles, California, I am currently in my third year of pursuing a degree in electrical engineering at BYU in Provo, Utah. When I'm not in the lab or working on personal projects, you can usually find me pursuing my hobbies as a photographer, rock climber, and backpacker! This website is an opportunity for me to share a bit about myself both professionally and personally.

To learn more about my professional skills, look in my __Projects__ tab to see my favorite things I've done and what I enjoy doing the most. You can find a full list of my skills in the __Resume__ tab.

To get to know me better personally, feel free to look at my __Blog__ tab to learn more about my stories and adventures! You can also view some of my favorite photos on my Flickr account and on my Instagram, both of which are linked on the left.
