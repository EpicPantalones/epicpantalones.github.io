My name is Ethan Sorensen. I'm from Los Angeles, California, currently in my third year at BYU studying electrical engineering. When I'm not in the lab or working on a personal project, I love to be with family and friends, and/or lost in the mountains somewhere! This website is an opportunity for me to share a bit about myself and my skills, as well as posting my personal story.


To see the professional me, look in my __Projects__ tab to see where my skills lie and what I'm currently working on. You can find a list of my skills and download link in the __Resume__ tab.


Also take a look at my __Blog__ tab to learn more about me as a person and see my hobbies and adventures!
