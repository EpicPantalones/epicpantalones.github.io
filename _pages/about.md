Welcome to my page!
======
My name is Ethan Sorensen. I'm a third year student at BYU studying electrical engineering. When I'm not in the lab or working on a personal project, I love to be out with family and friends, or lost in the woods somewhere. Take a look at some of my projects in the "projects" tab to see what I'm passionate about in school, and take a look at my "personality" tab to learn more about me.
